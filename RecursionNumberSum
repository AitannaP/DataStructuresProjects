Write a recursive function that does the following:

Given a number, add all the digits and display the sum. 
Example:
		The sum of the number 5432 would be 14.


Do not use the static modifier. No global variables. Your program should 
implement a non-tail recursive algorithm. In other words, it should do something 
as it moves towards the base case, the tail, and also do something as it comes back 
from the tail to the beginning.
 
The input is going to be received as a single integer from the user, 
in the main function. The input will not be more than four digits long (
no validation necessary).
